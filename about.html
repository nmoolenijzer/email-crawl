	    Nick Moolenijzer, born in late 1994 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has been exposed to 
	    many environments that have shaped his photography throughout his life. 
	    From swimming with the ocean life living near the Great Barrier Reef to keeping Floridian alligators from 
	    eating another of his cats, Nick has been influenced by the greatest work of art on Earth: nature. 
	    Although he has already lived on three different continents in his short life, 
	    including Australia where he gained a short-lived Australian accent, 
	    he now resides with his parents in Texas and goes to college in New Hampshire where he independently maintains Warwax Photography.
